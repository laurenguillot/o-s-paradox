## Combine ANES and City Lab DATA

Make two vectors for state and congressional district in city lab data like in ANES data

```{r}
citylab_re <- citylab_re %>%
  separate("CD", (c("stabbrev", "congdist0")), sep = "-")
```

Add leading 0s to the ANES data
```{r}
econ2016recode$congdist0 <- str_pad(econ2016recode$congdist, width = 2, side = "left", pad = "0")
```


# Combine econ2016recode and geo2016recoded

```{r}
combine2016 <- merge(econ2016recode, citylab_re, by = c("stabbrev", "congdist0"))
```
