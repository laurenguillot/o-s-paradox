## Base line: how well political ID (x = libcon) predicts issue positions (y = fecon2016)
```{r}
base <- lm(fecon2016 ~ libcon, data = combine2016)

summary(base)
```

- significant to the 0.05
- a 1 unit change in libcon -> 2 unit change in issue positions
- R sq shows it predicts about 41% of cases

## Model 1: effect cluster has on the relationship between ideological ID and issue position
```{r}
one <- lm(fecon2016 ~ libcon + clust, data = combine2016)

summary(one)
```
